# notes
- speedtest-cli: "it is not a goal of this application to be a reliable latency reporting tool," good enough for learning purposes
- tkinter gui, log and read using pandas
- select test durations of 2-60 mins
- progress bar incrimented after each test loop based on reference to remaining time

# to-do
- improve organization
- save log to csv option
